title: Namespaces
---

In Ory Permissions, namespaces fulfill two purposes:

- They are used to scope [objects](./objects.mdx) and [subjects](./subjects.mdx).
- They contain rules about which [relationships](./relation-tuples.mdx) should be looked up as part of a permission check.

A [relationship](./relation-tuples.mdx) can reference different namespaces. For example, a user (from the `User` namespace) can
have access to a file (from the `Document` namespace).

## Namespaces in the Ory Permission Language

In the Ory Permission Language, namespaces are defined as follows:

```ts
import { Namespace, Context } from "@ory/keto-namespace-types"

class User implements Namespace {}
class Document implements Namespace {}
class Folder implements Namespace {}
```

Each namespace holds a set of permissions, which define which relationships should be checked. For example, to check a `view`
permission for `User:bob` on an `readme.txt` in the `Document` namespace would entail the following relationship lookups:

```keto-relationships
is User:bob in viewers of Document:readme.txt // all viewers can view the document
is User:bob in editors of Document:readme.txt // all editors can view the document
is User:bob in owners of Document:readme.txt // all owners can view the document
```

Which relationships are checked precisely depends on the permission model.

## Naming conventions

Namesapces should be named after the singular form of the type they describe, in `UpperCamelCase` (for example: `User`,
`Document`, `Folder`, `AccessKey`).

Rationale: Namespaces are defined as TypeScript classes in the Ory Permission Language, and the convention for TypeScript classes
is `UpperCamelCase`.

Relationships within a namespace should be a word that describes what relation a subject has towards an object, in plural form. As
a rule of thumb, every relationship should translate to an english sentence like so:

```keto-relationships
Subject is in members of Object
```

Rationale: Relationships are like the edges in a graph connecting subjects and objects. These edges are always
[many-to-many relationships](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-to-many_(data_model)>), so the relationship should be in plural
form.
