title: Relationships

```mdx-code-block
import Mermaid from "@site/src/theme/Mermaid"
```

Relationships are the underlying datatype of Ory Permissions. They encode relations between [objects](./objects.mdx) (things that
you want to give access to) and [subjects](./subjects.mdx) (people or things that want to have access). A relationship is
associated with a [namespace](./namespaces.mdx) where its relation has to be defined and configured.

In a graphical sense, think of relationships as edges in a graph. For a simple relationship spelled as:

```keto-relationships
User:user1 is in members of Group:group1
User:user2 is in readers of Document:readme.txt
Folder:src is in parents of Document:package.json
```

```mdx-code-block
<Mermaid
  chart={`
graph LR
    User:user1 -->|members| Group:group1
    User:user2 -->|readers| Document:readme.txt
    Folder:src -->|members| Document:package.json
`}
/>
```

`User` and `Group` are the subject and object namespaces respectively. `user1` and `group1` are the subject and object.

In the original [Zanzibar paper by Google](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/), you will see the following notation for
relationships (called relationships there):

```keto-relation-tuples
Group:group1#members@User:user1
```

We prefer the notation above as it is more readable and easier to understand.

## Relationships and Permissions

Ultimately, permissions in Ory Keto are checked based on the relationships as well as the permission rules (see our
[permission modeling guide](../modeling/create-permission-model.mdx)). View the relationships as facts that are used to answer the
permission checks. For example, if a user is added to a group, add a relationship from the user (subject) through a `members`
relation to the group (object). Then, use the permission model to define the concrete permissions that are granted to the user by
being a member of this group.

## Basic Example

Head over to the [basic full feature example](../examples/olymp-file-sharing.mdx) to see an example with some context.
